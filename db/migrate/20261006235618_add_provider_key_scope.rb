# Gives provider keys a scope: "organization" for the key an account shares,
# "user:<id>" for one member's own key. The unique index on
# (account_id, scope_key, provider) keeps one organization key per provider
# and one personal key per member and provider. set_by_id names the user who
# last saved a key from the dashboard.
#
# Existing rows become organization rows. An install whose rows break the
# new index (two keys for one account and provider) stops here and lists
# them, because only one of each pair can stay and this migration does not
# choose. Guarded, so it is safe to re-run once they are resolved.

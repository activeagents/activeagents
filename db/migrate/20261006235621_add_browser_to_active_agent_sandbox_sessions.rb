# Browser sessions: a sandbox can run one browser, driven over MCP by the
# agents run against it. Each sandbox session records the browser's mode and
# status, where its MCP endpoint answers and the bearer token it expects
# (encrypted, like runtime_mcp_token), where a person can watch it, and when
# it started, which is what its minutes are counted from.
#
# Table names follow ActionAgent.table_name_prefix, the same way as
# create_active_agent_dashboard_tables.

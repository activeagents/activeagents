# Registers an Agent for each distinct agent action we observe in telemetry.
#
# Agents authored in the dashboard have records; agents running inside a
# customer's own app only ever reported traces, so the Agents list read 0 while
# Traces and Interactions were full of their runs. Ingest calls this to give
# every observed agent an identity that evaluations, versions, and per-agent
# metrics can hang off.
#
# Identity is (account, service_name, agent_class, agent_action) — one agent
# per action, not per class. Clara.respond (admin assistant, every MCP tool,
# ~$0.03/run) and Clara.title (no tools, temperature 0.2, ~$0.0004/run) are
# different agents that share a class name because one app method spawns both.
# Collapsing them would blend a $0.03 agent with a $0.0004 one into a single
# meaningless cost-per-run.
#
# Never raises: a registration failure must not fail a customer's telemetry.

# frozen_string_literal: true

# An evaluation definition for an agent: a named set of criteria scored
# against the agent's recorded behavior — its recent generations
# (solid_agent's agent_generations dataset) and its telemetry traces.
#
# Criteria are stored as an array of { "key", "type", "config" } hashes.
# Rule-based criterion types score each sampled generation
# deterministically; telemetry criterion types score aggregates over the
# agent's traces (error rate, latency); the llm_judge type asks a judge
# model to score each sample and requires a configured provider.
